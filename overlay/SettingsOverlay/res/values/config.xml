    <!-- The number of vibration intensity levels supported by the device.
         Note that this should correspond to the ability to vary the vibration amplitude, with
         enough dynamic range to have at least as many distinct intensity levels as defined here.
         Supported values are 1, 2, 3. If '1', the settings app will use a toggle for the settings,
         otherwise a slider. If '3', the settings app maps intensities directly to the levels
         supported by the Vibrator HAL APIs. If '2', then the levels will be mapped to
         VIBRATION_INTENSITY_LOW and VIBRATION_INTENSITY_HIGH, which gives the most range for
         scaling vibrations. The medium intensity will be skipped.
         The default intensity values are configured at
         frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml's config_default[type]VibrationIntensity.
         Make sure that each default intensity value is consistent with the supported levels set
         here. If this settings supports only 2 levels, for example, then the default intensity
         should be either LOW (1) or HIGH (3).
